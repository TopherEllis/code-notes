> [!IMPORTANT]
> I created this project a few years ago when I was still a student. It allowed me to explore exciting technologies like [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/fr/), [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).   
> I'm pleased to see that it has gained a substantial user base over time. However, due to my current commitments, I no longer have the time to maintain it. As a result, I am open to the possibility of someone else taking over the project by creating a fork.   
> Please note that this project is no longer maintained by me. Thank you very much for your understanding and for contributing to its growth. ‚ù§Ô∏è
